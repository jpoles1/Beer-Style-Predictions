# Beer-Style-Predictions
Predicting beer styles from Kaggle data set of over 75,000 homebrew recipes.

Dataset from: https://www.kaggle.com/jtrofe/beer-recipes

Predict the style of beer from thousands of different homebrew recipes. The beer style will be predicted off of characteristics of the boil (such as original gravity, final gravity, color). CART models and neural networks are used to predict the (currently) 7 different beer styles from the dataset. This multi-class prediction has a baseline of 35%. All CART models beat this by default, and the neural network scores at over 90% accuracy.
